- Need to unmount after copying has finished, not just sync (otherwise drive dirty bit is set)

- Zero4U hub can cause a device reset sometimes when drives are plugged in -- similar to https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/3634/raspberry-pi-reboots-on-plugging-in-a-usb-device?newreg=cdb497b39dd84684baea1f429ff4546b

- Add setup notes:
  - [N/A?] Add user "pi" to "disk" group so that they can manually mount and unmount and format disks without needing to type a password.
    (without this, disks end up getting owned by root when they get mounted using sudo):
    sudo usermod -a -G disk pi
  - Enable I2C and set data rate to 1Mbaud in config file
  - Disable graphical startup, and any unnecessary services
  - Add systemd task to start program
  
Write the following ( see https://github.com/RPi-Distro/repo/issues/137 ) to /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/90-mandatory.d/91-udisks2.pkla :

[udisks2]
Identity=unix-group:adm
Action=org.freedesktop.udisks2.*
ResultAny=yes
ResultInactive=yes
ResultActive=yes

TODO: or just run the program as root?
